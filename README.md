# moov-io/go-sftp

Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

GoSFTP provides a simple SFTP [client interface](https://github.com/moov-io/go-sftp/blob/master/client.go) for uploading, listing, and opening files on an SFTP server. 

```go
type Client interface {
	Ping() error
	Close() error

	Open(path string) (*File, error)
	Delete(path string) error
	UploadFile(path string, contents io.ReadCloser) error

	ListFiles(dir string) ([]string, error)
}
```

The library also includes a [mock client implementation](https://github.com/moov-io/go-sftp/blob/master/mock_client.go) which uses a local filesystem temporary directory for testing.

## Project status

Moov GoSFTP is actively used in production environments. Please star the project if you are interested in its progress. Please let us know if you encounter any bugs/unclear documentation or have feature suggestions by opening up an issue or pull request. Thanks!

## Contributing

Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started!

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go v1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/go-sftp/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

### Releasing

To make a release of go-sftp simply open a pull request with `CHANGELOG.md` and `version.go` updated with the next version number and details. You'll also need to push the tag (i.e. `git push origin v1.0.0`) to origin in order for CI to make the release.

### Testing

We maintain a comprehensive suite of unit tests and recommend table-driven testing when a particular function warrants several very similar test cases. To run all test files in the current directory, use `go test`. Current overall coverage can be found on [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/moov-io/go-sftp/).
